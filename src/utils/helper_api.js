/**
 * Executes a backtracking search to assign unique, compatible technicians to a list of
 * concurrent appointments and finds the set of maximum overlapping time slots available
 * for all assigned technicians.
 *
 * This function uses a recursive search to try all unique technician assignments for the
 * concurrent appointment groups. It prioritizes the best assignment (one with the most
 * available slots) where all assigned technicians are *real* (i.e., not "No Preference"),
 * before falling back to the best overall assignment.
 *
 * @param {Array<Array<Technician>>} appointmentTechMap - An array where each element is a list
 * of all compatible technicians for the corresponding concurrent appointment group.
 * @param {Array<Array<Service>>} appointments - The grouped services (concurrent appointments),
 * used by the slot calculation helper (`getCommonAvailableSlots`) to determine duration.
 * @param {Date} date - The date to check for schedule availability.
 * @returns {Promise<{assignedTechs: Technician[], commonSlots: string[]}>} A promise that
 * resolves to the best found assignment of technicians and their common available time slots.

/**
 * Calculates the booking availability and technician assignments for a group of services
 * on a specific date, attempting to find a single, common time slot.
 *
 * This process involves:
 * 1. Flattening the requested services based on quantity.
 * 2. Grouping the flattened services into concurrent 'appointments' based on the `groupSize`.
 * 3. For each concurrent appointment, finding all technicians who can perform the required service categories.
 * 4. Using an external service (`assignTechnicians`) to assign a specific technician to each appointment
 * and determine the common available time slots on the given date.
 * 5. Constructing structured booking forms based on the successful assignments and common slots.
 *
 * @param {Date|null} date - The target date for the booking.
 * @param {Service[]} selectedServices - An array of services requested, including their requested quantities.
 * @param {number} groupSize - The maximum number of concurrent services/appointments that can be handled simultaneously (e.g., number of treatment rooms or staff available).
 * @returns {Promise<AvailabilityResult>} A promise that resolves to an object containing structured booking forms and the common available time slots.
