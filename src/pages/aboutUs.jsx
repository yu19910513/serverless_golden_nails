                    <p>
                        Our story began in 1991, when our founders immigrated to Seattle
                        through the HO program after the Vietnam War. Already in their
                        mid-forties, with grown children, they started over with little more
                        than determination.

                    <p>
                        For nearly a decade, they labored side by side in Chinatown — he at the
                        sink, she among the tables and ledger books. Every dollar saved
                        went into small pieces of gold, their only wealth and security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the early 2000s, they sold the gold to pursue a dream of their
                        own. With those savings, they opened{" "}

                    <p>
                        From the early struggles of the 2002 recession to years of growth,
                        Golden Nails became a beloved name in Seattle. The original salon
                        still stands near the Space Needle, a reminder of where the journey
                        began.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2008, the family moved to Gig Harbor for a slower pace of life.
                        Dedicated owners like Helen and Lisa helped carry the Golden Nails
                        tradition forward, expanding and modernizing the salon while
                        preserving its spirit.

                        In 2024, the story came full circle. The founders’ granddaughter,
                        June, and her husband, Rex, took over Golden Nails in Gig Harbor,
                        alongside June’s mother, Tracy, who manages daily operations.

                        Though June is an engineer and Rex a pharmacist, their commitment to
                        family legacy guides every step. With Tracy’s experience, Helen’s
                        loyalty, and Lisa’s influence, Golden Nails continues to thrive.
